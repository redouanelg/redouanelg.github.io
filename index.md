Welcome to my personal webpage!

I am a [IRD](https://www.ird.fr) Research Engineer (permanent position) appointed at the [IPSL](https://www.ipsl.fr) (Institut Pierre-Simon Laplace) climate modeling center located in Sorbonne Université, Paris, France.

I am often referred to as an "interdisciplinary researcher/engineer", my work is focused on machine learning for climate modeling. 

Before my current position, I received a PhD in Computer Vision from [IMT Atlantique](https://www.imt-atlantique.fr) under the supervision of [Ronan Fablet](https://rfablet.github.io), my PhD thesis consisted in the use of analog methods (K-Nearest Neighbor Regression) to develop a new data-driven approach to tackle data assimilation: the Analog Data Assimilation (AnDA). In parallel to my thesis I investigated the use of deep learning methods for the segmentation of oceanic eddies from satellite-derived sea related maps. 

I then decided to take a step towards the ocean modeling community and went to do two postdocs in two Physical Oceanography labs. First one funded by the CNES (French Space Agency) at MEOM-IGE with [Julien Le Sommer](https://lesommer.github.io) on solving inverse problems for the SWOT altimeter. The second was funded by V. Balaji's ["Make Our Planet Great Again"](https://makeourplanetgreatagain-cnrs.com/) grant that I did in LOCEAN-IPSL with [V. Balaji](https://www.schmidtfutures.com/person/v-balaji/) and [Julie Deshayes](https://juliedeshayes.github.io/) on the tuning of climate models using surrogate modeling.
